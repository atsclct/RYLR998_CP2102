# RYLR998_CP2102
This code is developed to read transmission from LORA RYLR module on pico with sensors using a linux or mac computer. However, it is easy to change to COMXX for windows applications. There is a code available on github to use the module with Micropython with UART (https://github.com/wybiral/micropython-rylr/). However, to connect the module with a TTL-USB converter to a computer, I had difficult time to find a working code. Therefore, this is the code I came up with to receive data. It should be easy to change to sending data as well.
