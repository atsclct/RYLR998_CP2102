# RYLR998_CP2102
This code is to read LORA RYLR module transmission on a MAC. There is a code available on github to use the module with Micropython with UART. However, to connect the module with a TTL-USB converter to a computer, I had difficult time to find a code. Therefore, this is the code for that purpose.
